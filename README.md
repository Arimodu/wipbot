### NOTE: requires BeatSaberPlus
also, make sure your channel moderation settings allow posting links in chat, otherwise only VIPs and above can post wip requests
# 

This plugin adds 2 new commands to your Twitch chat.

``!wip (url)``  
This command can be used by anyone to request a wip. Url should be a link to a .zip file hosted on discord or google drive.  
After someone has requested a wip, press the "Download WIP" button in the mods panel and the map should show up in the WIP playlist.

``!bsrdl (bsr code)``  
This command can only be used by the streamer. It downloads a map based on a BSR key. Intended as a backup in case the in-game map downloaders fail for whatever reason.
