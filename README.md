# wipbot for beat saber streamers
### NOTE: requires BeatSaberPlus
# 

I was annoyed at having to manually download files, extract them and move folders while streaming when people request me to test a WIP map so i made this plugin

other wip bots require discord servers and are more complicated in general so I didn't want to bother with those

this one is as simple as it gets. just drop it into your plugins folder and youre done.

It adds 2 new commands to your Twitch chat

``!wip (url)``  
this command can be used by anyone to request a wip. url should be a direct download link to a zip file (has to start with https:// and end with .zip). easiest way to host files is to upload it anywhere on discord, right click the download button and click "Copy Link" (NOT "Copy Message Link")

after someone has requested a wip, press the "Download WIP" button in the mods panel on the left in the main menu in beat saber. after it has finished downloading press "Refresh Playlists" so it actually shows up in the WIP playlist

there is also a secret second command that only the streamer can use

``!bsrdl (bsr code)``  
this downloads a map based on a BSR key. because sometimes the in-game map downloaders fail for whatever reason and then you have to manually download it from beatsaver and go thru the manual file moving process, so i added this command to avoid having to go through that
